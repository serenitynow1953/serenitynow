      <p><h2>Opening Versicles</h2><p>✠ O Lord, open thou our lips.<br>℟. And our mouth shall shew forth thy praise.<br><h2>Opening Versicles</h2><p>✠ O God, make speed to save us.<br>℟. O Lord, make haste to help us.<br>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;<br>As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br>Alleluia.<br><h2>Invitatory</h2><h3>Psalm 95</h3><br>O come, let us sing unto the Lord: * let us heartily rejoice in the strength of our salvation.<br>Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving: * and shew ourselves glad in him with psalms.<br>For the Lord is a great God: * and a great King above all gods.<br>In his hand are all the corners of the earth: * and the strength of the hills is his also.<br>The sea is his, and he made it: * and his hands prepared the dry land.<br>O come, let us worship and fall down: * and kneel before the Lord our Maker.<br>For he is the Lord our God: * and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand.<br>To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts: * as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness;<br>When your fathers tempted me: * proved me, and saw my works.<br>Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said: * It is a people that do err in their hearts, for they have not known my ways:<br>Unto whom I sware in my wrath: * that they should not enter into my rest.<br>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;<br>As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br><h2>Psalm</h2><h3>Psalm 19</h3><br>The heavens declare the glory of God; * and the firmament sheweth his handywork.<br>One day telleth another; * and one night certifieth another.<br>There is neither speech nor language; * but their voices are heard among them.<br>Their sound is gone out into all lands; * and their words into the ends of the world.<br>In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun; * which cometh forth as a bridegroom out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a giant to run his course.<br>It goeth forth from the uttermost part of the heaven, and runneth about unto the end of it again; * and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.<br>The law of the Lord is an undefiled law, converting the soul; * the testimony of the Lord is sure, and giveth wisdom unto the simple.<br>The statutes of the Lord are right, and rejoice the heart; * the commandment of the Lord is pure, and giveth light unto the eyes.<br>The fear of the Lord is clean, and endureth for ever; * the judgements of the Lord are true, and righteous altogether.<br>More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold; * sweeter also than honey, and the honeycomb.<br>Moreover, by them is thy servant taught; * and in keeping of them there is great reward.<br>Who can tell how oft he offendeth? * O cleanse thou me from my secret faults.<br>Keep thy servant also from presumptuous sins, lest they get the dominion over me; * so shall I be undefiled, and innocent from the great offence.<br>Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be alway acceptable in thy sight, * O Lord, my strength and my redeemer.<br><h2>Scripture Reading</h2><h3>Romans 8:14–18</h3><br>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.<br>For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.<br>The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:<br>And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.<br>For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.<br>℟. Thanks be to God.<br><h2>Canticle</h2><h3>Te Deum laudamus</h3><br>We praise thee, O God: * we acknowledge thee to be the Lord.<br>All the earth doth worship thee: * the Father everlasting.<br>To thee all Angels cry aloud: * the heavens and all the powers therein.<br>To thee Cherubim and Seraphim: * continually do cry,<br>Holy, holy, holy: * Lord God of Sabaoth;<br>Heaven and earth are full of the majesty: * of thy glory.<br>The glorious company of the Apostles: * praise thee.<br>The goodly fellowship of the Prophets: * praise thee.<br>The noble army of Martyrs: * praise thee.<br>The holy Church throughout all the world: * doth acknowledge thee;<br>The Father: * of an infinite majesty;<br>Thine honourable, true: * and only Son;<br>Also the Holy Ghost: * the Comforter.<br>Thou art the King of glory: * O Christ.<br>Thou art the everlasting Son: * of the Father.<br>When thou tookest upon thee to deliver man: * thou didst not abhor the Virgin's womb.<br>When thou hadst overcome the sharpness of death: * thou didst open the kingdom of heaven to all believers.<br>Thou sittest at the right hand of God: * in the glory of the Father.<br>We believe that thou shalt come: * to be our Judge.<br>We therefore pray thee, help thy servants: * whom thou hast redeemed with thy precious blood.<br>Make them to be numbered with thy Saints: * in glory everlasting.<br><h2>The Preces</h2><br>✠ Lord, have mercy upon us.<br>℟. Christ, have mercy upon us.<br>✠ Lord, have mercy upon us.<br>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.<br>Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.<br>And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.<br>℣. O Lord, shew thy mercy upon us;<br>℟. And grant us thy salvation.<br>℣. O Lord, save thy people;<br>℟. And bless thine inheritance.<br>℣. Give peace in our time, O Lord;<br>℟. Because there is none other that fighteth for us, but only thou, O God.<br>℣. O God, make clean our hearts within us;<br>℟. And take not thy Holy Spirit from us.<br><h2>The Collect</h2><br>O God, who makest us glad with the weekly remembrance of the glorious resurrection of thy Son our Lord: Grant us this day such blessing through our worship of thee, that the days to come may be spent in thy favor; through the same Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<br><h2>The General Thanksgiving</h2><br>Almighty God, Father of all mercies,<br>We thine unworthy servants do give thee most humble and hearty thanks<br>For all thy goodness and loving-kindness to us and to all men.<br>We bless thee for our creation, preservation, and all the blessings of this life;<br>But above all for thine inestimable love in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ;<br>For the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.<br>And, we beseech thee, give us that due sense of all thy mercies,<br>That our hearts may be unfeignedly thankful;<br>And that we shew forth thy praise, not only with our lips, but in our lives,<br>By giving up ourselves to thy service, and by walking before thee<br>In holiness and righteousness all our days;<br>Through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom with thee and the Holy Ghost,<br>Be all honour and glory, world without end. Amen.<br><h2>Intercessions</h2><h3>A Prayer for All Sorts and Conditions of Men</h3><br>O God, the Creator and Preserver of all mankind,<br>We humbly beseech thee for all sorts and conditions of men;<br>That thou wouldest be pleased to make thy ways known unto them,<br>Thy saving health unto all nations.<br>More especially we pray for thy holy Church universal;<br>That it may be so guided and governed by thy good Spirit,<br>That all who profess and call themselves Christians may be led into the way of truth,<br>And hold the faith in unity of spirit, in the bond of peace, and in righteousness of life.<br>Finally, we commend to thy fatherly goodness all those who are in any ways afflicted, or distressed,<br>In mind, body, or estate; (especially those for whom our prayers are desired;)<br>That it may please thee to comfort and relieve them, according to their several necessities,<br>Giving them patience under their sufferings, and a happy issue out of all their afflictions.<br>And this we beg for Jesus Christ his sake. Amen.<br><h2>Conclusion</h2><br>✠ The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God,<br>And the fellowship of the Holy Ghost be with us all evermore. Amen.</p>
