      <p><h2>Opening Versicles</h2><p>✠ O God, make speed to save us.<br>℟. O Lord, make haste to help us.<br>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;<br>As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br>Alleluia.<br><h2>Hymn</h2><h3>Phos Hilarion</h3><br>O gracious Light, pure brightness of the everliving Father in heaven, * O Jesus Christ, holy and blessed!<br>Now as we come to the setting of the sun, * and our eyes behold the vesper light,<br>We sing thy praises, O God: * Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.<br>Thou art worthy at all times to be praised by happy voices: * O Son of God, O Giver of life, and to be glorified through all the worlds.<br><h2>Psalm</h2><h3>Psalm 134</h3><br>Behold now, praise the Lord: * all ye servants of the Lord;<br>Ye that by night stand in the house of the Lord: * even in the courts of the house of our God.<br>Lift up your hands in the sanctuary: * and praise the Lord.<br>The Lord that made heaven and earth: * give thee blessing out of Sion.<br><h2>Scripture Reading</h2><h3>Philippians 4:6–9</h3><br>Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.<br>And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.<br>Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.<br>Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.<br>℟. Thanks be to God.<br><h2>Canticle</h2><h3>Laudate Dominum (Psalm 117)</h3><br>O praise the Lord, all ye nations; * praise him, all ye peoples.<br>For his merciful kindness is ever more and more toward us: * and the truth of the Lord endureth for ever.<br>Praise the Lord.<br><h2>The Preces</h2><br>✠ The Lord be with you.<br>℟. And with thy spirit.<br>Let us pray.<br>Lord, have mercy upon us.<br>Christ, have mercy upon us.<br>Lord, have mercy upon us.<br>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy Name...<br>℟. Amen.<br><h2>The Collect</h2><br>O God, the source of eternal light: Shed forth thine unending day upon us who watch for thee, that our lips may praise thee, our lives may bless thee, and our worship on the morrow may give thee glory; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<br><h2>The General Thanksgiving</h2><br>Almighty God, Father of all mercies, we thine unworthy servants do give thee most humble and hearty thanks...<br>For all thy goodness and loving-kindness to us and to all men...<br>We bless thee for our creation, preservation, and all the blessings of this life...<br>But above all for thine inestimable love in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ...<br>For the means of grace, and for the hope of glory...<br>And we beseech thee, give us that due sense of all thy mercies...<br>That our hearts may be unfeignedly thankful, and that we shew forth thy praise...<br>Not only with our lips, but in our lives, by giving up ourselves to thy service...<br>And by walking before thee in holiness and righteousness all our days...<br>Through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom with thee and the Holy Ghost be all honour and glory, world without end. Amen.<br><h2>Intercessions</h2><h3>A Prayer for All Sorts and Conditions of Men</h3><br>O God, the Creator and Preserver of all mankind...<br>We humbly beseech thee for all sorts and conditions of men...<br>That thou wouldest be pleased to make thy ways known unto them, thy saving health unto all nations...<br>More especially, we pray for the good estate of the Catholic Church...<br>That it may be so guided and governed by thy good Spirit...<br>That all who profess and call themselves Christians may be led into the way of truth...<br>And hold the faith in unity of spirit, in the bond of peace, and in righteousness of life...<br>Finally, we commend to thy fatherly goodness all those who are in any ways afflicted or distressed...<br>That it may please thee to comfort and relieve them according to their several necessities...<br>Giving them patience under their sufferings, and a happy issue out of all their afflictions...<br>And this we beg for Jesus Christ’s sake. Amen.<br><h2>Conclusion</h2><br>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us all evermore. Amen.</p>
