      <p><h2>Opening Versicles</h2><p>✠ O Lord, open thou our lips.<br>℟. And our mouth shall shew forth thy praise.<br><h2>Opening Versicles</h2><p>✠ O God, make speed to save us.<br>℟. O Lord, make haste to help us.<br>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;<br>As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br>Alleluia.<br><h2>Invitatory</h2><h3>Psalm 95</h3><br>O come, let us sing unto the Lord: * let us heartily rejoice in the strength of our salvation.<br>Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving: * and shew ourselves glad in him with psalms.<br>For the Lord is a great God: * and a great King above all gods.<br>In his hand are all the corners of the earth: * and the strength of the hills is his also.<br>The sea is his, and he made it: * and his hands prepared the dry land.<br>O come, let us worship and fall down: * and kneel before the Lord our Maker.<br>For he is the Lord our God: * and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand.<br>To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts: * as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness;<br>When your fathers tempted me: * proved me, and saw my works.<br>Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said: * It is a people that do err in their hearts, for they have not known my ways:<br>Unto whom I sware in my wrath: * that they should not enter into my rest.<br>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;<br>As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br><h2>Psalm</h2><h3>Psalm 1</h3><br>Blessed is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, * nor stood in the way of sinners, and hath not sat in the seat of the scornful.<br>But his delight is in the law of the Lord; * and in his law will he exercise himself day and night.<br>And he shall be like a tree planted by the waterside, * that will bring forth his fruit in due season.<br>His leaf also shall not wither; * and look, whatsoever he doeth, it shall prosper.<br>As for the ungodly, it is not so with them: * but they are like the chaff, which the wind scattereth away from the face of the earth.<br>Therefore the ungodly shall not be able to stand in the judgement: * neither the sinners in the congregation of the righteous.<br>But the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous: * and the way of the ungodly shall perish.<br><h2>Scripture Reading</h2><h3>Ephesians 6:10–18</h3><br>Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.<br>Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.<br>For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.<br>Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.<br>Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;<br>And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;<br>Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.<br>And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:<br>Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;<br>℟. Thanks be to God.<br><h2>Canticle</h2><h3>Cantemus Domino</h3><br>I will sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously: * the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.<br>The Lord is my strength and song, * and he is become my salvation.<br>He is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; * my father’s God, and I will exalt him.<br>The Lord is a man of war: * the Lord is his name.<br><h2>The Preces</h2><br>✠ Lord, have mercy upon us.<br>℟. Christ, have mercy upon us.<br>✠ Lord, have mercy upon us.<br>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.<br>Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.<br>And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.<br>℣. O Lord, shew thy mercy upon us;<br>℟. And grant us thy salvation.<br>℣. O Lord, save thy people;<br>℟. And bless thine inheritance.<br>℣. Give peace in our time, O Lord;<br>℟. Because there is none other that fighteth for us, but only thou, O God.<br>℣. O God, make clean our hearts within us;<br>℟. And take not thy Holy Spirit from us.<br><h2>The Collect</h2><br>Almighty and everlasting God, by whose Spirit the whole body of thy faithful people is governed and sanctified: Receive our supplications and prayers which we offer before thee for all members of thy holy Church, that in their vocation and ministry they may truly and godly serve thee; through our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><h2>The General Thanksgiving</h2><br>Almighty God, Father of all mercies,<br>We thine unworthy servants do give thee most humble and hearty thanks<br>For all thy goodness and loving-kindness to us and to all men.<br>We bless thee for our creation, preservation, and all the blessings of this life;<br>But above all for thine inestimable love in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ;<br>For the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.<br>And, we beseech thee, give us that due sense of all thy mercies,<br>That our hearts may be unfeignedly thankful;<br>And that we shew forth thy praise, not only with our lips, but in our lives,<br>By giving up ourselves to thy service, and by walking before thee<br>In holiness and righteousness all our days;<br>Through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom with thee and the Holy Ghost,<br>Be all honour and glory, world without end. Amen.<br><h2>Intercessions</h2><h3>A Prayer for All Sorts and Conditions of Men</h3><br>O God, the Creator and Preserver of all mankind,<br>We humbly beseech thee for all sorts and conditions of men;<br>That thou wouldest be pleased to make thy ways known unto them,<br>Thy saving health unto all nations.<br>More especially we pray for thy holy Church universal;<br>That it may be so guided and governed by thy good Spirit,<br>That all who profess and call themselves Christians may be led into the way of truth,<br>And hold the faith in unity of spirit, in the bond of peace, and in righteousness of life.<br>Finally, we commend to thy fatherly goodness all those who are in any ways afflicted, or distressed,<br>In mind, body, or estate; (especially those for whom our prayers are desired;)<br>That it may please thee to comfort and relieve them, according to their several necessities,<br>Giving them patience under their sufferings, and a happy issue out of all their afflictions.<br>And this we beg for Jesus Christ his sake. Amen.<br><h2>Conclusion</h2><br>✠ The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God,<br>And the fellowship of the Holy Ghost be with us all evermore. Amen.</p>
