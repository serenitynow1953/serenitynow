      <p><h2>Opening Versicles</h2><p>✠ O God, make speed to save us.<br>℟. O Lord, make haste to help us.<br>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;<br>As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br>Alleluia.<br><h2>Hymn</h2><h3>Phos Hilarion</h3><br>O gracious Light, pure brightness of the everliving Father in heaven, * O Jesus Christ, holy and blessed!<br>Now as we come to the setting of the sun, * and our eyes behold the vesper light,<br>We sing thy praises, O God: * Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.<br>Thou art worthy at all times to be praised by happy voices: * O Son of God, O Giver of life, and to be glorified through all the worlds.<br><h2>Psalm</h2><h3>Psalm 113</h3><br>Praise the Lord, ye servants: * O praise the Name of the Lord.<br>Blessed be the Name of the Lord: * from this time forth for evermore.<br>The Lord's Name is praised: * from the rising up of the sun unto the going down of the same.<br>The Lord is high above all nations: * and his glory above the heavens.<br>Who is like unto the Lord our God, that hath his dwelling so high: * and yet humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven and earth?<br>He taketh up the simple out of the dust: * and lifteth the poor out of the mire;<br>That he may set him with the princes: * even with the princes of his people.<br>He maketh the barren woman to keep house: * and to be a joyful mother of children.<br><h2>Scripture Reading</h2><h3>Revelation 21:1–4</h3><br>And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.<br>And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.<br>And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.<br>And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.<br>℟. Thanks be to God.<br><h2>Canticle</h2><h3>Magnificat</h3><br>My soul doth magnify the Lord, * and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.<br>For he hath regarded * the lowliness of his handmaiden.<br>For behold, from henceforth * all generations shall call me blessed.<br>For he that is mighty hath magnified me; * and holy is his Name.<br>And his mercy is on them that fear him * throughout all generations.<br>He hath shewed strength with his arm; * he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.<br>He hath put down the mighty from their seat, * and hath exalted the humble and meek.<br>He hath filled the hungry with good things, * and the rich he hath sent empty away.<br>He remembering his mercy hath holpen his servant Israel, * as he promised to our forefathers, Abraham and his seed for ever.<br>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost;<br>As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, * world without end. Amen.<br><h2>The Preces</h2><br>✠ The Lord be with you.<br>℟. And with thy spirit.<br>Let us pray.<br>Lord, have mercy upon us.<br>Christ, have mercy upon us.<br>Lord, have mercy upon us.<br>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy Name...<br>℟. Amen.<br><h2>The Collect</h2><br>Lord God, whose Son our Saviour Jesus Christ triumphed over the powers of death, and prepared for us a place in the new Jerusalem: Grant us, we beseech thee, who have this day given thanks for his resurrection, that we may praise thee in that City of which he is the light, and where he liveth and reigneth for ever and ever. Amen.<br><h2>The General Thanksgiving</h2><br>Almighty God, Father of all mercies, we thine unworthy servants do give thee most humble and hearty thanks...<br>For all thy goodness and loving-kindness to us and to all men...<br>We bless thee for our creation, preservation, and all the blessings of this life...<br>But above all for thine inestimable love in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ...<br>For the means of grace, and for the hope of glory...<br>And we beseech thee, give us that due sense of all thy mercies...<br>That our hearts may be unfeignedly thankful, and that we shew forth thy praise...<br>Not only with our lips, but in our lives, by giving up ourselves to thy service...<br>And by walking before thee in holiness and righteousness all our days...<br>Through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom with thee and the Holy Ghost be all honour and glory, world without end. Amen.<br><h2>Intercessions</h2><h3>A Prayer for All Sorts and Conditions of Men</h3><br>O God, the Creator and Preserver of all mankind...<br>We humbly beseech thee for all sorts and conditions of men...<br>That thou wouldest be pleased to make thy ways known unto them, thy saving health unto all nations...<br>More especially, we pray for the good estate of the Catholic Church...<br>That it may be so guided and governed by thy good Spirit...<br>That all who profess and call themselves Christians may be led into the way of truth...<br>And hold the faith in unity of spirit, in the bond of peace, and in righteousness of life...<br>Finally, we commend to thy fatherly goodness all those who are in any ways afflicted or distressed...<br>That it may please thee to comfort and relieve them according to their several necessities...<br>Giving them patience under their sufferings, and a happy issue out of all their afflictions...<br>And this we beg for Jesus Christ’s sake. Amen.<br><h2>Conclusion</h2><br>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us all evermore. Amen.</p>
