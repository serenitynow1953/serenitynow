<section><h2>Opening Prayer</h2>
<p class="stanza">O God of My Understanding, this is the dawn of a new day in recovery. I thank you, my Higher Power, for last night&#x27;s rest, a blessed gift from you.</p>
<p class="stanza">Yesterday is gone, except for what I have learned from it, good or bad. Today, I have the same choice, a divine privilege which swells in my heart with hope and purpose. This is my day, the purity of a new beginning. I will receive from this day exactly what I give to it. As I do good things, good will be done to me. It is my gift to mold into something everlasting and do those things which will affect the people around me in an ever-widening circle. The worthiness of this effort rests entirely with me.</p>
<p class="stanza">This is my day for love, because I know that as I love, I will be loved. Hate and jealously cannot exist in the presence of love. I will be sustained by this miracle of your creation, and this day will be lightened by my love for others, especially love for my fellow travelers in the journey of recovery.</p>
<p class="stanza">Today I will do my best without thought of the failures of the past or anxieties for the future. When this day is ended, I will have no regrets nor remorse. When I retire tonight, I will thank you, my Higher Power, for this wonderful day.</p>

<section><h2>Daylight Prayers</h2>
<p class="stanza">O Higher Power, my true and only Light: receive my morning prayers, and illumine this day with your morning goodness, that no evil may overshadow me.</p>
<p class="stanza">Holy Wisdom, enlighten me with the brightness of your presence, that I may both know your will and be enabled to perform it. Light my way when I am lost, and inspire me with your truth, that I may live with an awakened mind, an open heart, and a willing spirit.</p>
<p class="stanza">O gracious God, thank you for bringing me safely to the light of this new day:  Preserve me with your mighty power, that I may not fall into temptation, nor be overcome by adversity; and in all I do, direct me to the fulfilling of your purpose. Amen.</p>

<section><h2>I Arise Today</h2>
<p class="stanza">I arise today, through God&#x27;s strength to pilot me:
God&#x27;s might to uphold me,
God&#x27;s wisdom to guide me,
God&#x27;s eye to look before me,
God&#x27;s ear to hear me,
God&#x27;s word to speak for me,
God&#x27;s hand to guard me,
God&#x27;s way to lie before me,
God&#x27;s shield to protect me,
God&#x27;s host to secure me:
against snares of devils,
against temptations of vices,
against inclinations of nature,
against everyone who shall wish me ill,
afar and anear, alone and in a crowd.</p>
</section>
<section><h2>Eleventh Step Morning Prayer</h2>
<p class="stanza">O God, direct my thinking today:<br>   that it be divorced from self-pity, dishonesty, and selfishness.<br>Place my thought-life on a much higher plane,<br>   and clear my mind of wrong motives.<br>Meet my indecision with your inspiration:<br>   replace my old ideas with fresh intuition.<br>Show me all day what my next step is to be,<br>   and give me the strength to meet any difficulty.<br>Grant me freedom from self-will run riot,<br>   and help me live with serenity and integrity.</p>
</section>
<section><h2>Acceptance Prayer</h2>
<p class="stanza">Dear God, Help me find the strength to be effective and accept responsibility. I am asking You for the strength I need each day. You have proven in countless lives that for very day I live, You will give me that necessary power. I must face every challenge that comes to me during the day sure that You will give me the strength to face it. I pray that I may accept every task as a challenge. I know I cannot wholly fail if you are with me.</p>
</section>
<section><h2>Concluding Recovery Prayers</h2>
<p class="stanza">God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.</p>
<p class="stanza">God, I offer myself to Thee — to build with me and to do with me as Thou wilt. Relieve me of the bondage of self, that I may better do Thy will. Take away my difficulties, that victory over them may bear witness to those I would help of Thy Power, Thy Love, and Thy Way of life. May I do Thy will always! .</p>
<p class="stanza">God, take my will and my life. Guide me in my recovery. Show me how to live.</p>
<p class="stanza">God, help me become willing to let go of all the things to which I still cling. Help me to be ready to let you remove all of these defects, that your will and purpose may take their place.</p>
<p class="stanza">My Creator, I am now willing that you should have all of me, good and bad. I pray that you now remove from me every single defect of character which stands in the way of my usefulness to you and my fellows. Grant me strength, as I go out from here, to do your bidding. Amen.</p>

<section><h2>Sanskrit Proverb</h2>
<p class="stanza">Look to this day,<br>For it is life,<br>The very life of life.<br>In its brief course lie all<br>The realities and verities of existence,<br>The bliss of growth,<br>The splendor of action<br>The glory of power—</p>
<p class="stanza">For yesterday is but a dream<br>And tomorrow is only a vision<br>But today, well lived,<br>Makes every yesterday a dream of happiness<br>And every tomorrow a vision of hope.</p>
<p class="stanza">Look well, therefore, to this day!</p>
