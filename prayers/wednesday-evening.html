      <p><h2>Opening Versicles</h2><p>✠ O God, make speed to save us.<br>℟. O Lord, make haste to help us.<br>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;<br>As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br>Alleluia.<br><h2>Hymn</h2><h3>Phos Hilarion</h3><br>O gracious Light, pure brightness of the everliving Father in heaven, * O Jesus Christ, holy and blessed!<br>Now as we come to the setting of the sun, * and our eyes behold the vesper light,<br>We sing thy praises, O God: * Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.<br>Thou art worthy at all times to be praised by happy voices: * O Son of God, O Giver of life, and to be glorified through all the worlds.<br><h2>Psalm</h2><h3>Psalm 27</h3>:1–7<br>The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom then shall I fear? * the Lord is the strength of my life; of whom then shall I be afraid?<br>When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, * they stumbled and fell.<br>Though an host of men were laid against me, yet shall not my heart be afraid: * and though there rose up war against me, yet will I put my trust in him.<br>One thing have I desired of the Lord, which I will require: * even that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life,<br>To behold the fair beauty of the Lord, * and to visit his temple.<br>For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his tabernacle: * yea, in the secret place of his dwelling shall he hide me, and set me up upon a rock of stone.<br>And now shall he lift up mine head: * above mine enemies round about me.<br><h2>Scripture Reading</h2><h3>Luke 24:28–35</h3><br>And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.<br>But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.<br>And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.<br>And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.<br>And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?<br>And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,<br>Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.<br>And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.<br>℟. Thanks be to God.<br><h2>Canticle</h2><h3>Deus misereatur (Psalm 67)</h3><br>God be merciful unto us, and bless us, * and shew us the light of his countenance, and be merciful unto us;<br>That thy way may be known upon earth, * thy saving health among all nations.<br>Let the people praise thee, O God; * yea, let all the people praise thee.<br>O let the nations rejoice and be glad; * for thou shalt judge the folk righteously, and govern the nations upon earth.<br>Let the people praise thee, O God; * yea, let all the people praise thee.<br>Then shall the earth bring forth her increase; * and God, even our own God, shall give us his blessing.<br>God shall bless us; * and all the ends of the world shall fear him.<br><h2>The Preces</h2><br>✠ The Lord be with you.<br>℟. And with thy spirit.<br>Let us pray.<br>Lord, have mercy upon us.<br>Christ, have mercy upon us.<br>Lord, have mercy upon us.<br>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy Name...<br>℟. Amen.<br><h2>The Collect</h2><br>O God, who art the unfailing providence of all who trust in thee: Mercifully accept our supplications; and because through the weakness of our mortal nature we can do nought without thee, grant us the help of thy grace, that in keeping thy commandments we may please thee both in will and deed; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<br><h2>The General Thanksgiving</h2><br>Almighty God, Father of all mercies, we thine unworthy servants do give thee most humble and hearty thanks...<br>For all thy goodness and loving-kindness to us and to all men...<br>We bless thee for our creation, preservation, and all the blessings of this life...<br>But above all for thine inestimable love in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ...<br>For the means of grace, and for the hope of glory...<br>And we beseech thee, give us that due sense of all thy mercies...<br>That our hearts may be unfeignedly thankful, and that we shew forth thy praise...<br>Not only with our lips, but in our lives, by giving up ourselves to thy service...<br>And by walking before thee in holiness and righteousness all our days...<br>Through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom with thee and the Holy Ghost be all honour and glory, world without end. Amen.<br><h2>Intercessions</h2><h3>A Prayer for All Sorts and Conditions of Men</h3><br>O God, the Creator and Preserver of all mankind...<br>We humbly beseech thee for all sorts and conditions of men...<br>That thou wouldest be pleased to make thy ways known unto them, thy saving health unto all nations...<br>More especially, we pray for the good estate of the Catholic Church...<br>That it may be so guided and governed by thy good Spirit...<br>That all who profess and call themselves Christians may be led into the way of truth...<br>And hold the faith in unity of spirit, in the bond of peace, and in righteousness of life...<br>Finally, we commend to thy fatherly goodness all those who are in any ways afflicted or distressed...<br>That it may please thee to comfort and relieve them according to their several necessities...<br>Giving them patience under their sufferings, and a happy issue out of all their afflictions...<br>And this we beg for Jesus Christ’s sake. Amen.<br><h2>Conclusion</h2><br>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us all evermore. Amen.</p>
