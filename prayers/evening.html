<p class="stanza">We pray that You will guide our footsteps tomorrow,<br>Help us as we help ourselves,<br>And help us as we help others to do Your will.<br>And we pray that you will extend your special mercy to those afflicted, as we have been,<br>But who have not yet been brought from darkness to light.</p>

<section><h2>Eleventh Step Evening Prayer</h2>
<p class="stanza">O God, forgive me where I have been<br>   resentful, selfish, dishonest, or afraid today.<br>Help me know what I need to share with another person;<br>   show me where I owe and apology, and help me make it.<br>Help me to be kind and loving to all people,<br>   And use me in the mainstream of life.<br>Remove remorse, worry, and morbid reflection,<br>   that I may rest with serenity and rise tomorrow to do Your will.</p>
</section>
<section><h2>An Evening Litany</h2>
<p class="stanza">For all I have accomplished this day,<br>   I praise God’s name.<br>For those tasks I have left undone,<br>   I seek God’s peace.<br>For the wounds I have given or received,<br>   I seek God’s healing.<br>For an evening that is joyful, restful, and good<br>   I seek God’s presence.<br>For my hopes and concerns for tomorrow,<br>   I seek God’s blessing.<br>For trust that God’s love is all we need,<br>      I turn to God’s mercy.</p>
<p class="stanza">That you will grant a quiet night and a grateful heart<br>   I pray to you, O Lord.<br>That you will protect those who work and watch this night:<br>   I pray to you, O Lord<br>That you will comfort all who weep or worry:<br>   I pray to you, O Lord.<br>That you will soothe the suffering and shield the joyous:<br>   I pray to you, O Lord<br>That you will give rest to the weary and hope for tomorrow:<br>   I pray to you, O Lord</p>
</section>
<section><h2>“Saint Francis” Prayer</h2>
<ul>
<li>Lord, make me a channel of thy peace</li>
<li>that where there is hatred, I may bring love</li>
<li>that where there is wrong, I may bring the spirit of forgiveness</li>
<li>that where there is discord, I may bring harmony</li>
<li>that where there is error, I may bring truth</li>
<li>that where there is doubt, I may bring faith</li>
<li>that where there is despair, I may bring hope</li>
<li>that where there are shadows, I may bring light</li>
<li>that where there is sadness, I may bring joy.</li>
</ul>
<p class="stanza">Lord, grant that I may seek rather<br>to comfort than to be comforted –<br>to understand than to be understood –<br>to love, than to be loved.<br>For it is by self-forgetting that one finds.<br>It is by forgiving that one is forgiven.<br>It is by dying that one awakens to Eternal Life.</p>

<section><h2>Concluding Prayers</h2>
<p class="stanza">Almighty God, Father of darkened skies and slumbering earth, I glorify you for the gifts of the night. I bless you for the quiet darkness, a gentle cloak, bringing rest and peace after the clamor of the day. I praise you for its dazzling stars, scattered like diamonds across the cosmos. And I thank you for the glowing moon, your watchful guardian in the sky, waxing and waning to the rhythms of creation.</p>
<p class="stanza">Pardon me, O Divine Weaver, where I have threaded discord into the day that has passed. By your mercy, may this night be a sanctuary for weary souls, a time of refreshment and peace. Give me the grace to rise tomorrow with hopeful hearts and eager hands, that I may weave threads of love and kindness into the tapestry of your world.</p>
<p class="stanza">O Eternal Light, shine in my heart. Eternal Goodness, deliver me from evil. Eternal Power, be my strength. Eternal Wisdom, scatter the darkness of ignorance. Eternal Pity, have mercy upon me, my friends and family, and all your children – this night and forever more..</p>
<p class="stanza">God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. Amen.</p>
