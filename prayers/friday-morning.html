      <p><h2>Opening Versicles</h2><p>✠ O Lord, open thou our lips.<br>℟. And our mouth shall shew forth thy praise.<br><h2>Opening Versicles</h2><p>✠ O God, make speed to save us.<br>℟. O Lord, make haste to help us.<br>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;<br>As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br>Alleluia.<br><h2>Invitatory</h2><h3>Psalm 95</h3><br>O come, let us sing unto the Lord: * let us heartily rejoice in the strength of our salvation.<br>Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving: * and shew ourselves glad in him with psalms.<br>For the Lord is a great God: * and a great King above all gods.<br>In his hand are all the corners of the earth: * and the strength of the hills is his also.<br>The sea is his, and he made it: * and his hands prepared the dry land.<br>O come, let us worship and fall down: * and kneel before the Lord our Maker.<br>For he is the Lord our God: * and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand.<br>To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts: * as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness;<br>When your fathers tempted me: * proved me, and saw my works.<br>Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said: * It is a people that do err in their hearts, for they have not known my ways:<br>Unto whom I sware in my wrath: * that they should not enter into my rest.<br>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;<br>As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br><h2>Psalm</h2><h3>Psalm 51</h3><br>Have mercy upon me, O God, after thy great goodness: * according to the multitude of thy mercies do away mine offences.<br>Wash me throughly from my wickedness: * and cleanse me from my sin.<br>For I acknowledge my faults: * and my sin is ever before me.<br>Against thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: * that thou mightest be justified in thy saying, and clear when thou art judged.<br>Behold, I was shapen in wickedness: * and in sin hath my mother conceived me.<br>But lo, thou requirest truth in the inward parts: * and shalt make me to understand wisdom secretly.<br>Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: * thou shalt wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.<br>Thou shalt make me hear of joy and gladness: * that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice.<br>Turn thy face from my sins: * and put out all my misdeeds.<br>Make me a clean heart, O God: * and renew a right spirit within me.<br>Cast me not away from thy presence: * and take not thy holy Spirit from me.<br>O give me the comfort of thy help again: * and stablish me with thy free Spirit.<br>Then shall I teach thy ways unto the wicked: * and sinners shall be converted unto thee.<br><h2>Scripture Reading</h2><h3>Isaiah 53:3–6</h3><br>He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief:<br>And we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.<br>Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.<br>But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities:<br>The chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.<br>All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way;<br>And the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.<br>℟. Thanks be to God.<br><h2>Canticle</h2><h3>Pascha nostrum</h3><br>Christ our passover is sacrificed for us: * therefore let us keep the feast;<br>Not with the old leaven, * neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness;<br>But with the unleavened bread * of sincerity and truth.<br>Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; * death hath no more dominion over him.<br>For in that he died, he died unto sin once: * but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.<br>Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin: * but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.<br><h2>The Preces</h2><br>✠ Lord, have mercy upon us.<br>℟. Christ, have mercy upon us.<br>✠ Lord, have mercy upon us.<br>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.<br>Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.<br>And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.<br>℣. O Lord, shew thy mercy upon us;<br>℟. And grant us thy salvation.<br>℣. O Lord, save thy people;<br>℟. And bless thine inheritance.<br>℣. Give peace in our time, O Lord;<br>℟. Because there is none other that fighteth for us, but only thou, O God.<br>℣. O God, make clean our hearts within us;<br>℟. And take not thy Holy Spirit from us.<br><h2>The Collect</h2><br>Almighty God, whose most dear Son went not up to joy but first he suffered pain, and entered not into glory before he was crucified: Mercifully grant that we, walking in the way of the cross, may find it none other than the way of life and peace; through the same thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<br><h2>The General Thanksgiving</h2><br>Almighty God, Father of all mercies,<br>We thine unworthy servants do give thee most humble and hearty thanks<br>For all thy goodness and loving-kindness to us and to all men.<br>We bless thee for our creation, preservation, and all the blessings of this life;<br>But above all for thine inestimable love in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ;<br>For the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.<br>And, we beseech thee, give us that due sense of all thy mercies,<br>That our hearts may be unfeignedly thankful;<br>And that we shew forth thy praise, not only with our lips, but in our lives,<br>By giving up ourselves to thy service, and by walking before thee<br>In holiness and righteousness all our days;<br>Through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom with thee and the Holy Ghost,<br>Be all honour and glory, world without end. Amen.<br><h2>Intercessions</h2><h3>A Prayer for All Sorts and Conditions of Men</h3><br>O God, the Creator and Preserver of all mankind,<br>We humbly beseech thee for all sorts and conditions of men;<br>That thou wouldest be pleased to make thy ways known unto them,<br>Thy saving health unto all nations.<br>More especially we pray for thy holy Church universal;<br>That it may be so guided and governed by thy good Spirit,<br>That all who profess and call themselves Christians may be led into the way of truth,<br>And hold the faith in unity of spirit, in the bond of peace, and in righteousness of life.<br>Finally, we commend to thy fatherly goodness all those who are in any ways afflicted, or distressed,<br>In mind, body, or estate; (especially those for whom our prayers are desired;)<br>That it may please thee to comfort and relieve them, according to their several necessities,<br>Giving them patience under their sufferings, and a happy issue out of all their afflictions.<br>And this we beg for Jesus Christ his sake. Amen.<br><h2>Conclusion</h2><br>✠ The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God,<br>And the fellowship of the Holy Ghost be with us all evermore. Amen.</p>
