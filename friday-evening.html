      <p><h2>Opening Versicles</h2><p>✠ O God, make speed to save us.<br>℟. O Lord, make haste to help us.<br>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;<br>As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br>Alleluia.<br><h2>Hymn</h2><h3>Phos Hilarion</h3><br>O gracious Light, pure brightness of the everliving Father in heaven, * O Jesus Christ, holy and blessed!<br>Now as we come to the setting of the sun, * and our eyes behold the vesper light,<br>We sing thy praises, O God: * Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.<br>Thou art worthy at all times to be praised by happy voices: * O Son of God, O Giver of life, and to be glorified through all the worlds.<br><h2>Psalm</h2><h3>Psalm 31</h3>:1–6<br>In thee, O Lord, have I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion, * deliver me in thy righteousness.<br>Bow down thine ear to me: * make haste to deliver me.<br>And be thou my strong rock, and house of defence: * that thou mayest save me.<br>For thou art my strong rock, and my castle: * be thou also my guide, and lead me for thy Name’s sake.<br>Draw me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: * for thou art my strength.<br>Into thy hands I commend my spirit: * for thou hast redeemed me, O Lord, thou God of truth.<br><h2>Scripture Reading</h2><h3>Romans 5:1–5</h3><br>Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:<br>By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.<br>And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;<br>And patience, experience; and experience, hope:<br>And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.<br>℟. Thanks be to God.<br><h2>Canticle</h2><h3>Miserere mei (Psalm 51:1–12)</h3><br>Have mercy upon me, O God, after thy great goodness: * according to the multitude of thy mercies do away mine offences.<br>Wash me throughly from my wickedness, * and cleanse me from my sin.<br>For I acknowledge my faults, * and my sin is ever before me.<br>Against thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight; * that thou mightest be justified in thy saying, and clear when thou art judged.<br>Behold, I was shapen in wickedness, * and in sin hath my mother conceived me.<br>But lo, thou requirest truth in the inward parts, * and shalt make me to understand wisdom secretly.<br>Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; * thou shalt wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.<br>Thou shalt make me hear of joy and gladness, * that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice.<br>Turn thy face from my sins, * and put out all my misdeeds.<br>Make me a clean heart, O God, * and renew a right spirit within me.<br>Cast me not away from thy presence, * and take not thy holy Spirit from me.<br>O give me the comfort of thy help again, * and stablish me with thy free Spirit.<br><h2>The Preces</h2><br>✠ The Lord be with you.<br>℟. And with thy spirit.<br>Let us pray.<br>Lord, have mercy upon us.<br>Christ, have mercy upon us.<br>Lord, have mercy upon us.<br>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy Name...<br>℟. Amen.<br><h2>The Collect</h2><br>Lord Jesus, stay with us, for evening is at hand and the day is past; be our companion in the way, kindle our hearts, and awaken hope, that we may know thee as thou art revealed in Scripture and the breaking of bread. Grant this for the sake of thy love. Amen.<br><h2>The General Thanksgiving</h2><br>Almighty God, Father of all mercies, we thine unworthy servants do give thee most humble and hearty thanks...<br>For all thy goodness and loving-kindness to us and to all men...<br>We bless thee for our creation, preservation, and all the blessings of this life...<br>But above all for thine inestimable love in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ...<br>For the means of grace, and for the hope of glory...<br>And we beseech thee, give us that due sense of all thy mercies...<br>That our hearts may be unfeignedly thankful, and that we shew forth thy praise...<br>Not only with our lips, but in our lives, by giving up ourselves to thy service...<br>And by walking before thee in holiness and righteousness all our days...<br>Through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom with thee and the Holy Ghost be all honour and glory, world without end. Amen.<br><h2>Intercessions</h2><h3>A Prayer for All Sorts and Conditions of Men</h3><br>O God, the Creator and Preserver of all mankind...<br>We humbly beseech thee for all sorts and conditions of men...<br>That thou wouldest be pleased to make thy ways known unto them, thy saving health unto all nations...<br>More especially, we pray for the good estate of the Catholic Church...<br>That it may be so guided and governed by thy good Spirit...<br>That all who profess and call themselves Christians may be led into the way of truth...<br>And hold the faith in unity of spirit, in the bond of peace, and in righteousness of life...<br>Finally, we commend to thy fatherly goodness all those who are in any ways afflicted or distressed...<br>That it may please thee to comfort and relieve them according to their several necessities...<br>Giving them patience under their sufferings, and a happy issue out of all their afflictions...<br>And this we beg for Jesus Christ’s sake. Amen.<br><h2>Conclusion</h2><br>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us all evermore. Amen.</p>
