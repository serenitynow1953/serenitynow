      <p><h2>Opening Versicles</h2><p>✠ O God, make speed to save us.<br>℟. O Lord, make haste to help us.<br>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;<br>As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br>Alleluia.<br><h2>Hymn</h2><h3>Phos Hilarion</h3><br>O gracious Light, pure brightness of the everliving Father in heaven, * O Jesus Christ, holy and blessed!<br>Now as we come to the setting of the sun, * and our eyes behold the vesper light,<br>We sing thy praises, O God: * Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.<br>Thou art worthy at all times to be praised by happy voices: * O Son of God, O Giver of life, and to be glorified through all the worlds.<br><h2>Psalm</h2><h3>Psalm 16</h3><br>Preserve me, O God: * for in thee have I put my trust.<br>O my soul, thou hast said unto the Lord: * Thou art my God, my goods are nothing unto thee.<br>All my delight is upon the saints that are in the earth: * and upon such as excel in virtue.<br>Their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer: * neither make mention of their names within my lips.<br>The Lord himself is the portion of mine inheritance, and of my cup: * thou shalt maintain my lot.<br>The lot is fallen unto me in a fair ground: * yea, I have a goodly heritage.<br>I will thank the Lord for giving me warning: * my reins also chasten me in the night season.<br>I have set God always before me: * for he is on my right hand, therefore I shall not fall.<br>Wherefore my heart was glad, and my glory rejoiced: * my flesh also shall rest in hope.<br>For why? thou shalt not leave my soul in hell: * neither shalt thou suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.<br>Thou shalt shew me the path of life; in thy presence is the fulness of joy: * and at thy right hand there is pleasure for evermore.<br><h2>Scripture Reading</h2><h3>Hebrews 4:14–16</h3><br>Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.<br>For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.<br>Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.<br>℟. Thanks be to God.<br><h2>Canticle</h2><h3>Ecce nunc (Psalm 134)</h3><br>Behold now, praise the Lord, * all ye servants of the Lord;<br>Ye that by night stand in the house of the Lord, * even in the courts of the house of our God.<br>Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, * and praise the Lord.<br>The Lord that made heaven and earth * give thee blessing out of Sion.<br><h2>The Preces</h2><br>✠ The Lord be with you.<br>℟. And with thy spirit.<br>Let us pray.<br>Lord, have mercy upon us.<br>Christ, have mercy upon us.<br>Lord, have mercy upon us.<br>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy Name...<br>℟. Amen.<br><h2>The Collect</h2><br>O Lord Jesus Christ, who by thy death didst take away the sting of death: Grant unto us thy servants so to follow in faith where thou hast led the way, that we may at length fall asleep peacefully in thee, and wake up after thy likeness; for thy tender mercies’ sake. Amen.<br><h2>The General Thanksgiving</h2><br>Almighty God, Father of all mercies, we thine unworthy servants do give thee most humble and hearty thanks...<br>For all thy goodness and loving-kindness to us and to all men...<br>We bless thee for our creation, preservation, and all the blessings of this life...<br>But above all for thine inestimable love in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ...<br>For the means of grace, and for the hope of glory...<br>And we beseech thee, give us that due sense of all thy mercies...<br>That our hearts may be unfeignedly thankful, and that we shew forth thy praise...<br>Not only with our lips, but in our lives, by giving up ourselves to thy service...<br>And by walking before thee in holiness and righteousness all our days...<br>Through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom with thee and the Holy Ghost be all honour and glory, world without end. Amen.<br><h2>Intercessions</h2><h3>A Prayer for All Sorts and Conditions of Men</h3><br>O God, the Creator and Preserver of all mankind...<br>We humbly beseech thee for all sorts and conditions of men...<br>That thou wouldest be pleased to make thy ways known unto them, thy saving health unto all nations...<br>More especially, we pray for the good estate of the Catholic Church...<br>That it may be so guided and governed by thy good Spirit...<br>That all who profess and call themselves Christians may be led into the way of truth...<br>And hold the faith in unity of spirit, in the bond of peace, and in righteousness of life...<br>Finally, we commend to thy fatherly goodness all those who are in any ways afflicted or distressed...<br>That it may please thee to comfort and relieve them according to their several necessities...<br>Giving them patience under their sufferings, and a happy issue out of all their afflictions...<br>And this we beg for Jesus Christ’s sake. Amen.<br><h2>Conclusion</h2><br>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us all evermore. Amen.</p>
