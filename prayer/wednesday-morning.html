      <p><h2>Opening Versicles</h2><p>✠ O Lord, open thou our lips.<br>℟. And our mouth shall shew forth thy praise.<br><h2>Opening Versicles</h2><p>✠ O God, make speed to save us.<br>℟. O Lord, make haste to help us.<br>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;<br>As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br>Alleluia.<br><h2>Invitatory</h2><h3>Psalm 95</h3><br>O come, let us sing unto the Lord: * let us heartily rejoice in the strength of our salvation.<br>Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving: * and shew ourselves glad in him with psalms.<br>For the Lord is a great God: * and a great King above all gods.<br>In his hand are all the corners of the earth: * and the strength of the hills is his also.<br>The sea is his, and he made it: * and his hands prepared the dry land.<br>O come, let us worship and fall down: * and kneel before the Lord our Maker.<br>For he is the Lord our God: * and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand.<br>To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts: * as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness;<br>When your fathers tempted me: * proved me, and saw my works.<br>Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said: * It is a people that do err in their hearts, for they have not known my ways:<br>Unto whom I sware in my wrath: * that they should not enter into my rest.<br>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;<br>As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br><h2>Psalm</h2><h3>Psalm 15</h3><br>Lord, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle? * or who shall rest upon thy holy hill?<br>Even he that leadeth an uncorrupt life, * and doeth the thing which is right, and speaketh the truth from his heart.<br>He that hath used no deceit in his tongue, nor done evil to his neighbour, * and hath not slandered his neighbour.<br>He that setteth not by himself, but is lowly in his own eyes, * and maketh much of them that fear the Lord.<br>He that sweareth unto his neighbour, and disappointeth him not; * though it were to his own hindrance.<br>He that hath not given his money upon usury, * nor taken reward against the innocent.<br>Whoso doeth these things * shall never fall.<br><h2>Scripture Reading</h2><h3>Colossians 3:12–17</h3><br>Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;<br>Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.<br>And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.<br>And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.<br>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.<br>And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.<br>℟. Thanks be to God.<br><h2>Canticle</h2><h3>Surge, illuminare</h3><br>Arise, shine; for thy light is come, * and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.<br>For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, * and gross darkness the people:<br>But the Lord shall arise upon thee, * and his glory shall be seen upon thee.<br>And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, * and kings to the brightness of thy rising.<br><h2>The Preces</h2><br>✠ Lord, have mercy upon us.<br>℟. Christ, have mercy upon us.<br>✠ Lord, have mercy upon us.<br>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.<br>Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.<br>And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.<br>℣. O Lord, shew thy mercy upon us;<br>℟. And grant us thy salvation.<br>℣. O Lord, save thy people;<br>℟. And bless thine inheritance.<br>℣. Give peace in our time, O Lord;<br>℟. Because there is none other that fighteth for us, but only thou, O God.<br>℣. O God, make clean our hearts within us;<br>℟. And take not thy Holy Spirit from us.<br><h2>The Collect</h2><br>O Lord, our Governor, whose glory is in all the world: We commend this nation to thy merciful care, that being guided by thy Providence, we may dwell secure in thy peace. Grant to the President of the United States, the Governor of this State, and to all in authority, wisdom and strength to know and to do thy will; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<br><h2>The General Thanksgiving</h2><br>Almighty God, Father of all mercies,<br>We thine unworthy servants do give thee most humble and hearty thanks<br>For all thy goodness and loving-kindness to us and to all men.<br>We bless thee for our creation, preservation, and all the blessings of this life;<br>But above all for thine inestimable love in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ;<br>For the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.<br>And, we beseech thee, give us that due sense of all thy mercies,<br>That our hearts may be unfeignedly thankful;<br>And that we shew forth thy praise, not only with our lips, but in our lives,<br>By giving up ourselves to thy service, and by walking before thee<br>In holiness and righteousness all our days;<br>Through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom with thee and the Holy Ghost,<br>Be all honour and glory, world without end. Amen.<br><h2>Intercessions</h2><h3>A Prayer for All Sorts and Conditions of Men</h3><br>O God, the Creator and Preserver of all mankind,<br>We humbly beseech thee for all sorts and conditions of men;<br>That thou wouldest be pleased to make thy ways known unto them,<br>Thy saving health unto all nations.<br>More especially we pray for thy holy Church universal;<br>That it may be so guided and governed by thy good Spirit,<br>That all who profess and call themselves Christians may be led into the way of truth,<br>And hold the faith in unity of spirit, in the bond of peace, and in righteousness of life.<br>Finally, we commend to thy fatherly goodness all those who are in any ways afflicted, or distressed,<br>In mind, body, or estate; (especially those for whom our prayers are desired;)<br>That it may please thee to comfort and relieve them, according to their several necessities,<br>Giving them patience under their sufferings, and a happy issue out of all their afflictions.<br>And this we beg for Jesus Christ his sake. Amen.<br><h2>Conclusion</h2><br>✠ The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God,<br>And the fellowship of the Holy Ghost be with us all evermore. Amen.</p>
