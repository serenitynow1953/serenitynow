      <p><h2>Opening Versicles</h2><p>✠ O God, make speed to save us.<br>℟. O Lord, make haste to help us.<br>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;<br>As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br>Alleluia.<br><h2>Hymn</h2><h3>Phos Hilarion</h3><br>O gracious Light, pure brightness of the everliving Father in heaven, * O Jesus Christ, holy and blessed!<br>Now as we come to the setting of the sun, * and our eyes behold the vesper light,<br>We sing thy praises, O God: * Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.<br>Thou art worthy at all times to be praised by happy voices: * O Son of God, O Giver of life, and to be glorified through all the worlds.<br><h2>Psalm</h2><h3>Psalm 4</h3><br>Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: * thou hast set me at liberty when I was in trouble.<br>Have mercy upon me, * and hearken unto my prayer.<br>O ye sons of men, how long will ye blaspheme mine honour: * and have such pleasure in vanity, and seek after leasing?<br>Know this also, that the Lord hath chosen to himself the man that is godly: * when I call upon the Lord, he will hear me.<br>Stand in awe, and sin not: * commune with your own heart, and in your chamber, and be still.<br>Offer the sacrifice of righteousness: * and put your trust in the Lord.<br>There be many that say: Who will shew us any good?<br>Lord, lift thou up * the light of thy countenance upon us.<br>Thou hast put gladness in my heart: * since the time that their corn and wine and oil increased.<br>I will lay me down in peace, and take my rest: * for it is thou, Lord, only, that makest me dwell in safety.<br><h2>Scripture Reading</h2><h3>2 Corinthians 4:6–10</h3><br>For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.<br>But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.<br>We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;<br>Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;<br>Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.<br>℟. Thanks be to God.<br><h2>Canticle</h2><h3>Nunc dimittis</h3><br>Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, * according to thy word.<br>For mine eyes have seen * thy salvation,<br>Which thou hast prepared * before the face of all people;<br>To be a light to lighten the Gentiles, * and to be the glory of thy people Israel.<br>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost;<br>As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, * world without end. Amen.<br><h2>The Preces</h2><br>✠ The Lord be with you.<br>℟. And with thy spirit.<br>Let us pray.<br>Lord, have mercy upon us.<br>Christ, have mercy upon us.<br>Lord, have mercy upon us.<br>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy Name...<br>℟. Amen.<br><h2>The Collect</h2><br>O God, whose blessed Son didst manifest himself to his disciples in the breaking of bread: Open, we pray thee, the eyes of our faith, that we may behold him in all his redeeming work; who liveth and reigneth with thee, in the unity of the Holy Ghost, one God, now and for ever. Amen.<br><h2>The General Thanksgiving</h2><br>Almighty God, Father of all mercies, we thine unworthy servants do give thee most humble and hearty thanks...<br>For all thy goodness and loving-kindness to us and to all men...<br>We bless thee for our creation, preservation, and all the blessings of this life...<br>But above all for thine inestimable love in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ...<br>For the means of grace, and for the hope of glory...<br>And we beseech thee, give us that due sense of all thy mercies...<br>That our hearts may be unfeignedly thankful, and that we shew forth thy praise...<br>Not only with our lips, but in our lives, by giving up ourselves to thy service...<br>And by walking before thee in holiness and righteousness all our days...<br>Through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom with thee and the Holy Ghost be all honour and glory, world without end. Amen.<br><h2>Intercessions</h2><h3>A Prayer for All Sorts and Conditions of Men</h3><br>O God, the Creator and Preserver of all mankind...<br>We humbly beseech thee for all sorts and conditions of men...<br>That thou wouldest be pleased to make thy ways known unto them, thy saving health unto all nations...<br>More especially, we pray for the good estate of the Catholic Church...<br>That it may be so guided and governed by thy good Spirit...<br>That all who profess and call themselves Christians may be led into the way of truth...<br>And hold the faith in unity of spirit, in the bond of peace, and in righteousness of life...<br>Finally, we commend to thy fatherly goodness all those who are in any ways afflicted or distressed...<br>That it may please thee to comfort and relieve them according to their several necessities...<br>Giving them patience under their sufferings, and a happy issue out of all their afflictions...<br>And this we beg for Jesus Christ’s sake. Amen.<br><h2>Conclusion</h2><br>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us all evermore. Amen.</p>
