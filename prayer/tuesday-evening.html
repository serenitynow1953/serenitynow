      <p><h2>Opening Versicles</h2><p>✠ O God, make speed to save us.<br>℟. O Lord, make haste to help us.<br>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;<br>As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br>Alleluia.<br><h2>Hymn</h2><h3>Phos Hilarion</h3><br>O gracious Light, pure brightness of the everliving Father in heaven, * O Jesus Christ, holy and blessed!<br>Now as we come to the setting of the sun, * and our eyes behold the vesper light,<br>We sing thy praises, O God: * Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.<br>Thou art worthy at all times to be praised by happy voices: * O Son of God, O Giver of life, and to be glorified through all the worlds.<br><h2>Psalm</h2><h3>Psalm 141</h3>:1–4<br>Lord, I call upon thee, haste thee unto me: * and consider my voice when I cry unto thee.<br>Let my prayer be set forth in thy sight as the incense: * and let the lifting up of my hands be an evening sacrifice.<br>Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth: * and keep the door of my lips.<br>O let not mine heart be inclined to any evil thing: * let me not be occupied in ungodly works with the men that work wickedness.<br><h2>Scripture Reading</h2><h3>1 Peter 5:6–11</h3><br>Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:<br>Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.<br>Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:<br>Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.<br>But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.<br>To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.<br>℟. Thanks be to God.<br><h2>Canticle</h2><h3>Cantate Domino (Psalm 98)</h3><br>O sing unto the Lord a new song; * for he hath done marvellous things.<br>With his own right hand, and with his holy arm, * hath he gotten himself the victory.<br>The Lord declared his salvation; * his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen.<br>He hath remembered his mercy and truth toward the house of Israel; * and all the ends of the world have seen the salvation of our God.<br>Shew yourselves joyful unto the Lord, all ye lands; * sing, rejoice, and give thanks.<br>Praise the Lord upon the harp; * sing to the harp with a psalm of thanksgiving.<br>With trumpets also and shawms, * O shew yourselves joyful before the Lord the King.<br>Let the sea make a noise, and all that therein is; * the round world, and they that dwell therein.<br>Let the floods clap their hands, and let the hills be joyful together before the Lord; * for he is come to judge the earth.<br>With righteousness shall he judge the world, * and the peoples with equity.<br><h2>The Preces</h2><br>✠ The Lord be with you.<br>℟. And with thy spirit.<br>Let us pray.<br>Lord, have mercy upon us.<br>Christ, have mercy upon us.<br>Lord, have mercy upon us.<br>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy Name...<br>℟. Amen.<br><h2>The Collect</h2><br>O God, the life of all who live, the light of the faithful, the strength of those who labour, and the repose of the dead: We give thee thanks for the timely blessings of the day, and humbly we beseech thy merciful protection all the night long. Bring us, we pray thee, in peace to the morning hours; through him who died for us and rose again, thy Son our Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.<br><h2>The General Thanksgiving</h2><br>Almighty God, Father of all mercies, we thine unworthy servants do give thee most humble and hearty thanks...<br>For all thy goodness and loving-kindness to us and to all men...<br>We bless thee for our creation, preservation, and all the blessings of this life...<br>But above all for thine inestimable love in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ...<br>For the means of grace, and for the hope of glory...<br>And we beseech thee, give us that due sense of all thy mercies...<br>That our hearts may be unfeignedly thankful, and that we shew forth thy praise...<br>Not only with our lips, but in our lives, by giving up ourselves to thy service...<br>And by walking before thee in holiness and righteousness all our days...<br>Through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom with thee and the Holy Ghost be all honour and glory, world without end. Amen.<br><h2>Intercessions</h2><h3>A Prayer for All Sorts and Conditions of Men</h3><br>O God, the Creator and Preserver of all mankind...<br>We humbly beseech thee for all sorts and conditions of men...<br>That thou wouldest be pleased to make thy ways known unto them, thy saving health unto all nations...<br>More especially, we pray for the good estate of the Catholic Church...<br>That it may be so guided and governed by thy good Spirit...<br>That all who profess and call themselves Christians may be led into the way of truth...<br>And hold the faith in unity of spirit, in the bond of peace, and in righteousness of life...<br>Finally, we commend to thy fatherly goodness all those who are in any ways afflicted or distressed...<br>That it may please thee to comfort and relieve them according to their several necessities...<br>Giving them patience under their sufferings, and a happy issue out of all their afflictions...<br>And this we beg for Jesus Christ’s sake. Amen.<br><h2>Conclusion</h2><br>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us all evermore. Amen.</p>
