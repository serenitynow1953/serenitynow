      <p><h2>Opening Versicles</h2><p>✠ O Lord, open thou our lips.<br>℟. And our mouth shall shew forth thy praise.<br><h2>Opening Versicles</h2><p>✠ O God, make speed to save us.<br>℟. O Lord, make haste to help us.<br>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;<br>As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br>Alleluia.<br><h2>Invitatory</h2><h3>Psalm 95</h3><br>O come, let us sing unto the Lord: * let us heartily rejoice in the strength of our salvation.<br>Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving: * and shew ourselves glad in him with psalms.<br>For the Lord is a great God: * and a great King above all gods.<br>In his hand are all the corners of the earth: * and the strength of the hills is his also.<br>The sea is his, and he made it: * and his hands prepared the dry land.<br>O come, let us worship and fall down: * and kneel before the Lord our Maker.<br>For he is the Lord our God: * and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand.<br>To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts: * as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness;<br>When your fathers tempted me: * proved me, and saw my works.<br>Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said: * It is a people that do err in their hearts, for they have not known my ways:<br>Unto whom I sware in my wrath: * that they should not enter into my rest.<br>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;<br>As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br><h2>Psalm</h2><h3>Psalm 5</h3><br>Give ear to my words, O Lord, * consider my meditation.<br>O hearken thou unto the voice of my calling, my King and my God: * for unto thee will I make my prayer.<br>My voice shalt thou hear betimes, O Lord: * early in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.<br>For thou art the God that hast no pleasure in wickedness: * neither shall any evil dwell with thee.<br>Such as be foolish shall not stand in thy sight: * for thou hatest all them that work vanity.<br>Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: * the Lord will abhor both the blood-thirsty and deceitful man.<br>But as for me, I will come into thine house, even upon the multitude of thy mercy: * and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.<br>Lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness, because of mine enemies: * make thy way plain before my face.<br>For there is no faithfulness in his mouth: * their inward parts are very wickedness.<br>Their throat is an open sepulchre: * they flatter with their tongue.<br>Destroy thou them, O God; * let them perish through their own imaginations.<br>Cast them out in the multitude of their ungodliness: * for they have rebelled against thee.<br>And let all them that put their trust in thee rejoice: * they shall ever be giving of thanks, because thou defendest them.<br>They that love thy Name shall be joyful in thee; * for thou, Lord, wilt give thy blessing unto the righteous.<br>And with thy favourable kindness wilt thou defend him: * as with a shield.<br><h2>Scripture Reading</h2><h3>Philippians 2:1–11</h3><br>If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,<br>Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.<br>Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.<br>Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.<br>Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:<br>Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:<br>But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:<br>And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.<br>Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:<br>That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;<br>And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.<br>℟. Thanks be to God.<br><h2>Canticle</h2><h3>Benedicite, omnia opera Domini</h3><br>O all ye Works of the Lord, bless ye the Lord: * praise him, and magnify him for ever.<br>O ye Angels of the Lord, bless ye the Lord: * praise him, and magnify him for ever.<br>O ye Heavens, bless ye the Lord: * praise him, and magnify him for ever.<br>O ye Waters that be above the firmament, bless ye the Lord: * praise him, and magnify him for ever.<br>O all ye Powers of the Lord, bless ye the Lord: * praise him, and magnify him for ever.<br>O ye Sun and Moon, bless ye the Lord: * praise him, and magnify him for ever.<br>O ye Stars of heaven, bless ye the Lord: * praise him, and magnify him for ever.<br>O ye Showers and Dew, bless ye the Lord: * praise him, and magnify him for ever.<br>O ye Winds of God, bless ye the Lord: * praise him, and magnify him for ever.<br>O ye Fire and Heat, bless ye the Lord: * praise him, and magnify him for ever.<br>O ye Winter and Summer, bless ye the Lord: * praise him, and magnify him for ever.<br>O ye Dews and Frosts, bless ye the Lord: * praise him, and magnify him for ever.<br>O ye Frost and Cold, bless ye the Lord: * praise him, and magnify him for ever.<br>O ye Ice and Snow, bless ye the Lord: * praise him, and magnify him for ever.<br>O ye Nights and Days, bless ye the Lord: * praise him, and magnify him for ever.<br>O ye Light and Darkness, bless ye the Lord: * praise him, and magnify him for ever.<br>O ye Lightnings and Clouds, bless ye the Lord: * praise him, and magnify him for ever.<br><h2>The Preces</h2><br>✠ Lord, have mercy upon us.<br>℟. Christ, have mercy upon us.<br>✠ Lord, have mercy upon us.<br>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.<br>Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.<br>And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.<br>℣. O Lord, shew thy mercy upon us;<br>℟. And grant us thy salvation.<br>℣. O Lord, save thy people;<br>℟. And bless thine inheritance.<br>℣. Give peace in our time, O Lord;<br>℟. Because there is none other that fighteth for us, but only thou, O God.<br>℣. O God, make clean our hearts within us;<br>℟. And take not thy Holy Spirit from us.<br><h2>The Collect</h2><br>O God, the King eternal, who dividest the day from the night and turnest the shadow of death into the morning: Drive far from us all wrong desires, incline our hearts to keep thy law, and guide our feet into the way of peace; that, having done thy will with cheerfulness while it was day, we may, when night cometh, rejoice to give thee thanks; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<br><h2>The General Thanksgiving</h2><br>Almighty God, Father of all mercies,<br>We thine unworthy servants do give thee most humble and hearty thanks<br>For all thy goodness and loving-kindness to us and to all men.<br>We bless thee for our creation, preservation, and all the blessings of this life;<br>But above all for thine inestimable love in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ;<br>For the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.<br>And, we beseech thee, give us that due sense of all thy mercies,<br>That our hearts may be unfeignedly thankful;<br>And that we shew forth thy praise, not only with our lips, but in our lives,<br>By giving up ourselves to thy service, and by walking before thee<br>In holiness and righteousness all our days;<br>Through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom with thee and the Holy Ghost,<br>Be all honour and glory, world without end. Amen.<br><h2>Intercessions</h2><h3>A Prayer for All Sorts and Conditions of Men</h3><br>O God, the Creator and Preserver of all mankind,<br>We humbly beseech thee for all sorts and conditions of men;<br>That thou wouldest be pleased to make thy ways known unto them,<br>Thy saving health unto all nations.<br>More especially we pray for thy holy Church universal;<br>That it may be so guided and governed by thy good Spirit,<br>That all who profess and call themselves Christians may be led into the way of truth,<br>And hold the faith in unity of spirit, in the bond of peace, and in righteousness of life.<br>Finally, we commend to thy fatherly goodness all those who are in any ways afflicted, or distressed,<br>In mind, body, or estate; (especially those for whom our prayers are desired;)<br>That it may please thee to comfort and relieve them, according to their several necessities,<br>Giving them patience under their sufferings, and a happy issue out of all their afflictions.<br>And this we beg for Jesus Christ his sake. Amen.<br><h2>Conclusion</h2><br>✠ The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God,<br>And the fellowship of the Holy Ghost be with us all evermore. Amen.</p>
